      CCTV is a closed-circuit television. It is a television system in which signals are monitored but not publicly distributed. The main reason for the use of CCTV is for surveillance and security purposes.
      
      The CCTV banks on the tactical placement of the cam by Walter Bruch, in 1942, in Germany. The operators made use of the very early forms of CCTV during wartime to monitor V-2 rockets.
      
      However, CCTV was not available commercially then. The purpose of the early form of CCTV was to capture lights and convert them to a video signal.
      
      Over the years, CCTV cameras have amazingly become part and parcel of our everyday life. They can be sighted in malls, shops, car parks, homes, offices, trains, airports, religious establishments and the like.
      
      Surveillance has become so important and common that no longer do we give it a second thought, we just do it!
      
      CCTV has evolved from what it used to be at its inception. The technical capacity of the cameras has evolved substantially since this form of surveillance was first introduced.
      
      CCTV became available commercially in 1949, seven years after the "live video capture" was invented. When it was released and available commercially, it quickly gained interest as an advanced security camera and was picked up by a government contractor in the United States of America.
      
      At the time, CCTV was not as technical as it is now. Rather than automated sensors, infrared cameras and body temperature detection. They provided live monitoring and streamed to monitors within the capacity to record the footage. There is almost nothing a CCTV cannot do when it comes to surveillance.
      
      A CCTV lens is made from glass and focuses light from the scene on the camera's image sensor. This is the width or height of the scene monitored by the CCTV camera.
      
      Essential components of CCTV surveillance.
      
      Its camera system uses surveillance cameras to keep track of the interior and exterior of a property, transmitting the signal to a monitor and giving real-time access to view.
      
      With so many benefits, CCTV has become so much needed in our societies. Especially in societies with high crime rates.
       
      Here are five essential components of the CCTV surveillance camera system.
      
      1. Camera: The CCTV camera must have two camera options.
      
      The Internet Protocol (IP) or analogue.
      
      The IP is usually preferred because of its compatibility with most devices. Different types of cameras can be installed, for example, dome cameras, bullet cameras, and convert cameras. It all depends on the number of angles you would like the camera to cover.
      
      2. The monitoring station: The monitoring station is the most important function of a security camera. This is used to view recorded images and footage captured by the surveillance system. The number of monitors needed is dependent on what you want to monitor and the area in which you want to monitor.
      
      Relatively, three to four screens are fine if you are not operating on a large-scale facility.
      
      3. Cables and Routers: Depending on the type of surveillance system and cameras of your choice, you will need other supporting techniques like cables and routers to be integrated into your system for a seamless connection. For instance, wireless systems require a router, while wired versions do not.
      
      This is why it's best to choose the wires and the cables after choosing the cameras and monitors according to your needs.
      
      4. Video Recorders: The video recorder is a device where videos recorded on the camera get processed for storage and viewing. We have two types of video recorders.
      
      The digital video recorder (Dvr) and the Network video recorder. (Nvr)
      
      5. Data storage: All CCTV surveillance systems are as good as the hard disk backing them up. The storage device for a security camera system must be able to record, store and replay videos non-stop.
      
      Regular hard drives that are used in PCs and Laptops are not well equipped to handle CCTV storage needs. Hence, it is utterly important to choose a robust storage system for safe data storage.
      
      CCTV cameras have become a vital necessity in our world so in the process of choosing your preferred security system, the five essential components, you need to keep in mind are
      - Camera
      - Monitor
      - Cable
      - Data storage
      - Video Recorder.
      
      There are high-definition CCTV cameras which allow you to monitor your environment in clearly defined ways.
      
      While also making the identification of perpetrators a very simple task.
      
      A high-definition CCTV allows remote access, which means you have the opportunity to view your property from anywhere in the world at any time, even with your phone.
      
      Advantages of a CCTV surveillance system.
      
      1. CCTV cameras help prevent and reduce theft. Having security cameras around your business and home helps prevent theft and intrusions. When they are installed in studies have shown that quite some small businesses lose a lot of money yearly due to acts of theft and other crimes. Having a CCTV surveillance system is very important to prevent such crimes.
      
      2. CCTV cameras help improve security: By installing CCTV surveillance systems in your homes and businesses, you are taking the right steps to protect your properties. By doing so, you no longer have to worry about intrusions, harassment and any other issues that may occur at the workplace as the surveillance system will capture everything.
      In addition, protecting your workers is just as important as keeping your household and business secure. Video cameras should be placed at entrances, parking lots, exits and the like.
      
      3. Improved productivity. Members of Your staff will be more productive and stay on their tasks if they know that there is a video surveillance system in place, to monitor their daily activities. Many establishments install the CCTV surveillance system not only to protect people from the outside breaking in but to also give insight and to ensure that your staff are staying on task and being productive.
      
      4. CCTV surveillance helps to view real-time monitoring of video surveillance cameras. This videos systems grant you access to monitor your business, environment or household all day, every day.
      This can be done from a phone, a computer, or a tablet and can also be viewed remotely from anywhere in the world.
      
      5. Reduced cost of security. When you have CCTV surveillance systems properly installed in the right locations and are consistently monitored, you don't exactly need to spend money on security guards.
      The benefits of a CCTV surveillance system are almost inexhaustible and the disadvantage one can only speak of is the fact that it is not cheap. But then, you are sure to get value for your money.
      
       Locations where the CCTV cameras can be positioned for proper surveillance.
      
      - Houses
      - Offices
      - Warehouses
      - Petrol stations
      - Retail stores
      - Religious establishments
      
      1. Houses. CCTV cameras can be installed at the external front entrances, back entrances, and driveways to monitor cars, storage areas and so on.
      
      2. Offices. For health safety purposes, stairways, outside lifts, and major and minor entrances and exits.
      
      3. Warehouses. Entrances and exits, machine operation areas communal areas, production areas and parking areas.
      
      4. Petrol stations: entrances and exits, mini-marts.
      
      5. Retail stores. The entrances and exits, the shelves, fridges and freezers, and the payment points.
      
      6. Religious establishments. Entrances, exits, parking lots, inner rooms and the like.
      
       Price of the CCTV
      
      In Nigeria, the price of CCTV installation varies from 150,000 NGN to 200,000 NGN
      However, the price depends on the type of camera surveillance system you prefer. The price is also dependent on the exchange rate and the economy generally.

      3. Advantages of an electric wire fencing
      4. Disadvantages of Electric wire Fencing.
      5. Maintenance of Electric wire Fences.
       
      Everyone wants a reasonable level of security for their properties which is very important.
      But quite a several people go about it wrongly.
      
      Imagine securing your house to the best of your knowledge and taste but still having intrusion issues.
      
      Burglars and intruders generally would attempt to scale or defeat your other types of security but you know what they would not dare do? They would not trespass when it's an electric fence!
      
      An electric wire fence is a barrier that makes use of electric shocks to prevent people or animals (Intruders generally) from intruding.
      
      The voltage of shocks has effects ranging from discomfort to death.
      
      Types of Electric wire Fences
      Electric wire fences are grouped into three major categories.
      
      1. Temporary Electric wire fence
      2. Semi-permanent Electric wire fences.
      3. Permanent Electric wire fences.
      
      Temporary electric fence: This is used for short periods. Usually for a few days. It has lightweight, so it is easy to move and it is reusable. This is a great option for short-term occasions. Although, thus Temporary Fencing is usually used as cross-fencing on rotational grazing systems, to construct portable carnal for livestock. It is also an option for keeping people inside an area. Preventing people from accessing an area could be used for decorative purposes as well.
      
      Temporary fencing can also be used around gardens or used as boundary line markers.
      
      Semi-permanent Electric wire Fences: These are constructed for a combination of both permanent and temporary components.
      
      They are often used for pastures.
      
      These types of fences can last 20 years. Semi-permanent fences usually take a bit longer to install and always require more accessories to install when compared to temporary fencing.
      Permanent electric wire fence: These can be made of wood, barbed wire, pipe, woven wire, vinyl or high tensile.
      
      A permanent electric wire fence is often electrified and when constructed well, can last more than 40 years.
      
      Though these electric wire fences require more maintenance and more accessories, permanent fencing can be used for any livestock (on farms) and last for a long time with low maintenance throughout the years after installation.
      
      There are a lot of factors, like height, strength, wiring, and what you intend to prevent from trespassing, be it humans or animals.
      
      A permanent fence combines the use of timber posts with durable steel or lines designed to give trouble-free fencing for many years.
      
      NOTE: For an electric fence to be properly installed, it should not be a closed loop. When a person touches the electric fence, this should be the missing link in the loop
      for the animal to get the shock.
      
      Advantages of Installing Electric wire fences.
      
      1. For Security against burglary, trespassing and vandalism.
      2. They are easy to build due to their lightweight construction materials.
      3. Minimum Maintenance needed.
      4. Electric fence installation is cheap when compared to barbed wires.
      
      Electric wire fence is by far one of the most effective ways of Protecting properties from unwanted visitors, burglars and the like. They also remain efficient for a long time without requiring repairs or intervention. Here are a few advantages of using electric fences to secure your properties.
      
      Electric fences have a reliable performance. Electric fences do exactly what they promise to do. Shock! Peradventure a person touches an electric fence, they will receive a sharp shock which is safe. (The safe kind of electric shock) It gives psychological and physical effects. The shock is calibrated to be powerful enough for the intruder to notice and record the shock and definitely won't forget it anytime soon.
      
      Electric fences give off a powerful shock, they are carefully calibrated to ensure that the shock is not fatal. If anybody accidentally comes in contact with the fence, they will feel the shock, but they are not at risk of losing their lives or having health issues.
      
      Electric wire fencing is an excellent long-term security invention. It is not just long-lasting, it is cost-effective with minimum maintenance required to keep it working in the long run.
      
      Electric wire fencing is cheap and easy to set up. Electric fences cost as much as regular non-electric fences and are easier to set up, they require a fraction of the maintenance.
      
      Electric fences are easy to install and uninstall compared to barbed wires, these workers are liable to get cuts during the cause of installation, and electric fences are easy to install and uninstall.
      
      Electric wire fences improve the aesthetic value of the property on it is installed: Electric fences just have a way of beautifying the property.
      
      Electric wire fences can be used for all regions either in rainy or sunny regions. Elective wire fences offer maximum protection and glam. Barb wires, on the other hand, may become rusty as the rains persist.
      
      Disadvantages
      Electric wire fences require regular maintenance.
      
      Poor grounding is a major common fault in electric fencing systems. If the ground is not completed correctly, the fencer cannot function at its maximum potential.
      
      Materials, recommendations and tips.
      
      Fencer: All the materials should be gotten from a well-trusted company, thus, ensuring good materials that will be backed by your supplier. When purchasing the fencer, you should purchase a fencer that is a little bit bigger than your requirement.
      
      You need nothing less than 2000 volts in the summer and 4000 volts in the winter due to thicker hair coats on the livestock and you usually do not get proper ground because of rain.
      
        Note: A lightning diverter should be installed.
      
      Ground Rods: The grounding system is the most important part of the fence. Make sure you will need a minimum of three 6- 8 foot long rods. Placed at least 2 metres away from the energizer/fencer and 3 meters apart from each other.
      
      The rods and clamps are connected back to the fencer using galvanized wire.
      
      Once the fence is installed, you should check to see if the fence is properly grounded. This is done by grounding out the fence with a metal bar and then checking the ground rods with a volt meter. If the reading on the voltmeter is higher than 200 volts, you need more ground rods. There should be no volt reading on the meter with a properly grounded fence.
      
        Note: Galvanized materials are highly recommended as they do not rust.
      
      Electric wire fence maintenance.
      
      One of the most useful tools would be a volt meter or a fault finder. This will help you ensure the proper voltage is being delivered regularly and if you have a fault finder, the repair process could be sped up by indicating the direction of the problem.
      
      DON'Ts of Electric wire fencing
      
        Do not use your gate wire to transfer power from one side of the base to the other.
        Don't over-tighten your wire during installation, you should only avoid slacking.
        Don't run the electric wire in conjunction with barbed wires.
        Don't use copper wire to connect ground rods to fencers because they corrode.
        Don't tighten the high tensile wire. If it has been kinked, it may break.
        Do not use low-quality or low-power supplies. This may get you replacing it now and then, consuming your time and money.

      Interior design is said to be the art and science of improving the interior of a building to achieve a healthy and beautiful environment for the users of the space. An interior design firm is a construction firm that constitutes a team of people who plan, research, coordinate and manage such enhancement projects.

      Interior design includes planning, site inspections, conceptual development, programming research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management and the actual execution of the design.
     
     In interior design, planning and design of man-made spaces are a part of environmental design and closely related to architecture.
     
      HISTORY
     
     Since the middle 20th century, the term interior decoration has been so loosely applied as to be nearly meaningless with the result that other, more descriptive terms have come to use.
     
     The term "interior design" indicates a broader area of activity and also suggests its status as a discipline. In some European countries, where the profession is well established, it is known as "interior architecture"
     
     The Principles of Interior Design.
     
     It is important to note that interior design is a specialised arm of architecture. It is also important to keep in mind that no specialised branch in any field would be very meaningful if practised in a context.
     
     Due to the technological complexity of contemporary planning and building, it is no longer possible for a single architect or designer to be an expert in all the many aspects that make up a modern building.
     
     It is however essential that the many specialists who make up a team be able to communicate with each other and have enough basic knowledge to carry out their common goals.
     
     While the architect usually concerns himself with the general design of the building, the interior designer is concerned with the more intimately scaled aspects of design, the specific aesthetics, functional and psychological questions involved and the individual character of spaces.
     
       Interior design can be categorized basically into two.
     
     1. Residential Interior design.
     
     2. Non-Residential interior design which is often also called contract design because of how the designer receives his compensation.
     
     The volume of business activities in the interior design field of the residential interior continues to grow, there seems to be less need and less challenge for the professional designer with the result that more and more qualified professionals are involved in non-residential work.
     
     The residential interior is usually a highly personal statement for both the answer and designer each of whom is involved with all aspects of the design.
     
     For example, furniture designing is carried out by industrial designers and furniture designers as well as by architects and interior designers. As a rule, furniture designed for mass production is usually designed by industrial designers, who usually design special pieces that are not readily available on the market or that must meet specific needs for a particular job. These needs may be functional or aesthetics, or better still, a combination of functionality and aesthetics. Such as special chairs, desks or shelves.
     
     Other functional and also aesthetically pleasing materials are fabrics, lighting devices, floor covering and all home furnishing products. All design activities are similar, even though the training and education in the different design fields vary in emphasis. A talented and well-trained designer can easily move from one specialised area to another with little difficulty.
     
     NOTE: There is a difference between ART and DESIGN.
     
     A designer is majorly concerned with the solution to problems (be they functional aesthetic or psychological) that are presented to him. The artist is more concerned with expressive ideas.
     
     Aesthetic Parts of the design
     
     An overall definition of beauty and aesthetic excellence would be hard but fortunately, many generally accepted principles can be used to achieve an understanding of the aesthetic considerations in design. It must be noted, however, that such understanding requires exposure and learning, an appreciation of any form of art needs such a background.
     
     Functionality and aesthetic are key in interior design however, using functionality as the only aesthetic criterion would be limiting but it certainly is a valid consideration to be kept in mind. Designers are often tempted to over-style or over-design an object or interior rather than design it.
     
     The aesthetic response to an interior and its finishing must take into consideration the social and economic conditions as well as the materials and technology of the time. The materials and technology of the time. The elegant interiors that are usually associated with the 18th and 19th centuries were appropriate to the wealthy bourgeois who were the original occupants. Such interiors would be strange to the 21st-century way of life and would be inappropriate for a contemporary middle-class family.
     
     All interiors occur inside buildings and therefore have a very real relationship to these buildings.
     
     The best interiors today, as well as in the past are those that relate well in character and appropriateness to the particular building.
     
     The furnishings designed and scaled for spacious country homes or palaces would be out of place in a small urban apartment or home.
     
     Elements of interior design
     
     Of all the elements that make up a completed interior, the most important element is space.
     
     Spaces can be exciting or depressing, cheerful or serene, all depending upon the use the designer has made of the various elements that form the whole space is costly. The beautiful spaces achieved their success through generous proportions and management.
     
     Due to the vast increase in construction costs in contemporary structures, spaces tend to be smaller and less generous more skills on the part of the designer are required to give such limited spaces a particular atmosphere or character. On the other hand, a large volume of space is not sufficient.
     
     A space needs not to be l large and monumental to be aesthetically successful. The handling of mass and form even within a small structure can become exciting and beautiful.
     
     Spaces can be thought of as the raw material which must be moulded and shaped with the designer's tools of colour, texture, light and scale.
     
     Interior design has a whole lot to do with space management while incorporating aesthetically pleasing furniture, lighting, paints, fabrics, flooring and the like to make up a beautiful space.

      "A Terrible nightmare" is how The Peters as a family would always describe every single rainy season at a point in their lives. They never looked forward to the rainy season.

      While others saw the rainy season as a Blessing, (Improved crop yield for farmers, reduction of dust on roads, cleaner air to breathe in and cool weather generally) it was not the same for the Peters'.
      
      The rainy season was their worst nightmare.
      
      This wasn't always their story anyway. At least not until the roof of their home started leaking.
      It all started like a joke. Then before they knew it, it became a bad joke. The family of 5 had to get to "work" whenever it started raining. Mopping from room to room, became tiring and frustrating.
      
      Now you would ask why they didn't reconstruct. They did, at least twice. It kept going from bad to worse.
      
      So, they decided to go back to the drawing board, to get to the root of the problem. Their dilemma stemmed back to the materials used in the construction and reconstruction of the roofs and the expertise of the workers. It was nothing to write home about.
      
      The construction materials were found to have been substandard. They only enjoyed it for as long as they could till the substandard materials began to show the stuff they were made of. The materials wore out pretty fast and became a major problem for the family when the roof started leaking, which in turn made the family fear rain and sunlight.
      
      When it was sunny, the house was always extremely hot and when it rained, it poured into their home.
      
      The Peters continued in this dilemma for the longest time until they came across an MJ Factor Project online, Facebook to be precise.
      
      The actual owners of this project came out to speak on how they've been living in their house for over 15 years and have never had any form of trouble linked to the technical know-how of the company that handled their building project or the issues linked to substandard construction materials.
      
      " 15 years ago? Without any hitch so far? " Mr Peters thought to himself. Then he remembered something tragic that happened 15 years ago. It was the era when buildings kept collapsing. Some even collapsed while still under construction.
      
      It was a terrible era as lives and properties were lost.
      
      More like an epidemic of bad buildings. Buildings went from bad to worse within a very short period. Still thinking back, Mr Peters recalled one of his close friend's projects.
      His friend had embarked on at the time.
      
      Mr Peter's friend, Mr Obi was based in the UK so he wasn't exactly always around for the close monitoring. The few times he travelled down to Nigeria, being on the site 24/7 was the last thing he wanted to do as he had meetings and conferences to attend.
      So he trusted the construction company he told to handle the construction of his Estate. If only he knew.
      
      The project was a very huge project which included the construction of 20 duplexes, 10 bungalows and 40-storey buildings.
      
      This was going to be Mr Obi's retirement plan and he was super excited about it.
      By the time they got started, the word "substandard" overrates the description of the kind of materials made use of on the project.
      
      The construction company management saw this as an extortion opportunity and they extorted their client, Mr Obi.
      
      They did this by not buying enough materials, which made them "manage" materials and as for manual labour, they employed less than they needed on the project, thereby doubling the workload of the few workers available and in turn, slowing down the work on the construction site.
      
      One would wonder how these people got to run a construction company or how they got registered in the first place.
      
      Despite not being the best, they kept at it.
      
      Brick on brick, nails to wood, hinges to doors, doors to entrances and the like of that. They took it one day at a time.
      
      And because they had 70 houses to build in all, to at least start the Estate. Building from house to house, they continued.
      
      The painting jobs got started and truth be told, the paints covered up a lot of these buildings.
      
      Once, Mr Obi came to visit the site. It all appeared well to him and his only concern was the shortage of staff. The managers in charge assured him that they were going to get more workers to speed up the project.
      
      They got a few more workers indeed to at least fulfil the promise they made to their client, Mr Obi. This decision sped up the construction process a little bit.
      
      Weeks turned into months and months, into years. In the space of 4 years, all the scheduled buildings were completed and a lot of the buildings already had people living in them as the location of the Estate at the time, was a "hot cake"
      
      By this time, the occupants of the first houses were already having complaints. Water penetrated walls, walls were swelling, paints were peeling off and so much more.
      These complaints and many more kept rolling in, time and time again. Until the information got to Mr Obi.
      
      Some tenants even packed out and threatened to sue the entire estate management.
      
      On hearing the threats, Mr Obi came to inspect the buildings but this time around, he came with professionals. The buildings were inspected and it was noted that the buildings were not safe for people to live in them. And the fact that the occupants of the buildings paid a fortune per year to live in the unsafe buildings got them even angrier.
      
      Mr Obi was perplexed and even more heartbroken as this was his retirement plan. And the fact that a certified government body had declared these buildings unsafe for habitation as some of these buildings were even found to be crooked.
      
      Heaps of Lawsuits stared at him, and the pain of losing 70 houses also struck him. As the certified body had labelled the houses poorly constructed and marked them for demolition since they threatened the lives of occupants.
      
      Mr Obi was literally in debt.
      
      70 houses! An entire estate!!
      
        ...pain and pity were what Mr Peters felt for his friend as he recalled the great misfortune due to negligence and total trust in a company he didn't make proper research on about 15 years ago.
      
      But for this particular advert he saw online, and the fact that the house had lasted over 15 years.
      
      It looked too good to be true to Mr Peters because they could not relate.
      
      Long story cut short, they decided to trust MJ Factor with their reconstruction project. 
      
      Trusting wasn't easy because they had twice had their fingers burnt, but they did it anyway.
      It's been 5 years since MJ Factor handled the reconstruction and nothing comes close to the level of happiness and rest the family feels especially when it's raining.
      
      Thinking about their worst nightmare 5-7years ago, they as a family, are forever grateful for giving MJ factor the chance to fix their issue at the time.
      
      We take our time to source the best, standard, long-lasting and affordable construction materials for our client's projects while paying premium attention to visually pleasing materials as well as their functionalities.
      
      At MJ Factor, we build to last.
      
      Can you in any way relate to the Peters' worst nightmare?

      How to know a well-built building.

      Top 5 qualities to look out for in a good building.
      
      1. The building materials should be of good quality:
         
      Time. Time would always tell the difference between those who used substandard building materials a those who used good building materials for their building projects.
      
      You probably already know that Materials of good quality have long-lasting benefits.
      
      This gives you a level of security. Your mind is at rest concerning the project. You won't find yourself panicking or insecure about it why? Because you rest assured.
      
      Now, imagine your long-lasting building materials being handled by professionals in the construction industry. Perfection!
      
      Your building gives you exactly what it is supposed to give.
      
      MJ Factors has your interest at heart. All you need do is to check out our portfolio, past projects and current projects, then trust us to do an outstanding job with yours.
      
      2. It Should be airy and well-ventilated: A good building should have well-curated portals for air Exchange. To aid the proper exchange of hot and cool air.
      
      Science has proven that hot air moves up to create room for cool air beneath. The hot air eventually escapes through these available portals.
      
      A relatable example is opening the windows or the door when the room feels stuffy or feels like it has air trapped in for a couple of days.
      
      Cross ventilation is the top priority.
      
      This would be to the advantage of those who would eventually live or work in the building.
      Apart from that, the quality of the air you breathe in has effects (good or bad as the case may be) on your health.
      
      So it’s not just about having portals of air exchange, you need portals of quality air Exchange.
      
      Free Tip: Trees can be planted to help improve the quality of air in your environment which in turn helps improve the quality of life in the long run. They also give that natural cooling effect.
      
      3. The height of the building should be between 10ft-12ft.
      
      High ceilings help give the building a more spacious and luxurious look. It is also quite efficient.
      
      In warmer climates and situations where there are no air conditioning systems, high ceilings allow hot air to rise and the cool air to remain at the human level for easy access of the occupants to cool air, generally creating a cooling effect.
      
      High ceilings also have aesthetic benefits. They can be used for decorative purposes. And when you have some things hanging up there, it creates an illusion that space is bigger and this can help fix a “small room" problem.
      
      The above and many more are the advantages of a high ceiling.
      
      4. The designs of the interiors should be ergonomic:
      
      This is when comfort relates to functionality and aesthetics. The interiors should serve their purposes in the building while being visually pleasing and not at the expense of the comfort of the user. These three things should work hand in hand while generally promoting the looks of the building.
      
      The spaces should be well utilized and with the comfort of the user in mind as earlier stated.
      You will be surprised that by so doing, your setting or maybe a piece of art or even a table could be a great conversation starter in your home. This helps limit awkward silences. You are welcome.
      
      Note: The functionality of your interiors should never be at the expense of the comfort of the user. You spent your money on it. The least you should do is enjoy using it and not discomfort.
      
      5. Minimal greenhouse gas emissions: We would be biased if we do not include how to take care of mother earth in our post.
      
      Mother Earth has housed us for centuries upon centuries and it's only fair and responsible of us to give back. And in giving back, we are indirectly taking care of ourselves.
      
      Greenhouse gases are gases that absorb and emit radiant energy within the thermal infrared range, causing the greenhouse effect. Examples are methane and ozone. When these gases are released, they contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer which in turn exposes us more to the ultraviolet rays of the Sun. This exposure can lead to cancer of the skin.
      
      Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions happens by us increasing the energy efficiency of the buildings.
      
      This includes the installation of efficient lighting.
      
      The emission of greenhouse gases by a building can also be reduced by making power on-site with renewable materials and climate-friendly energy sources.

      You stopping by here right now to read this is not a coincidence. You have probably heard of or even seen the "POP" and wondered what it means. Or you're here to better your understanding of what you already know about POP.
      
      Whichever category you fall under, you are in the right place. And we sure will take our time to make sure that you have a great time exploring our Plaster of Paris installation blog post.
      
      When you are done here, you would have learned enough to educate a layman in this field about one or two new things you must have picked up in the course of your read on the Plaster of Paris.
      
      We never can tell, this knowledge may come in handy now or later in the nearest future.
      What is a POP ceiling?
      
      A POP is a false ceiling which is made from plaster Paris. It was given the name "plaster of Paris" because it was made from gypsum and located very close to Paris in France.
      What is the POP made of?
      
      The POP is made from gypsum plaster. The Plaster of Paris is formed when the gypsum is heated to the point where all moisture content present in it evaporates, leaving behind a powdered substance. The powdered substance left behind is a very fine, powder. The name of the chemical formed is calcium sulphate hemihydrates. The powdered substance is then mixed with water, to mould it into different types of shapes, sizes and forms. It is then left again, to dry.
      
      How is a plaster Of Paris ceiling Installed?
      
      This is fun because once you have skilled, artistic and willing artisans, you get to come up with a lot of new designs.
      
      Plaster Of Paris is quite soft when moist. So it can be easily moulded into whatever form is required of it. Being aware of this, the artisans get to first make a frame, the shape they would like the plaster of Paris to the in the ceiling. Then the chicken mesh is installed on the frame. Pipes, lighting and other electricals are drilled or planted in and properly fixed.
      
      The plaster of Paris is then added to the built frame finishing is done and you have your POP ceiling.
      
      Benefits of Plaster of Paris false Ceilings.
      
      There are quite some benefits of using the plaster of Paris false ceilings and we will be discussing a few.
      
      1. It is very durable. It takes a very long period before your well-installed plaster of Paris ceiling shows any signs of wear or tear. It is extremely durable compared to some other ceilings.
      
      2. Plaster of Paris can also be of great advantage when it comes to insulation in both cold and hot weather. It prevents the transmission of heat from the actual roof from accessing the space.
      
      3. It has very high fire resistance. This is a great advantage because, in case of fire outbreaks, this could be a fire chain breaker. It is fire-resistant because of the
      Chemicals it is made up of.
      
      4. The plaster of Paris costs little or nothing to maintain. As earlier stated, the plaster of Paris is very durable and can withstand a lot of extremities, especially heat and fire.
      Hanging up there, it can stay for fifteen to twenty years without falling or wearing off if properly installed.
      
      5. The Plaster of Paris avails artisans a high level of flexibility when it comes to designing and shaping the ceiling which is usually not the case using normal ceilings.
      
      6. The plaster of Paris ceilings is also detachable. Is that not amazing?
      
      Imagine you can detach your ceiling, fixing it to your favourite spot with a little help from the skilled artisans of course, without having to go through the full stress of constructing from the scratch.
      
      Disadvantages of the Plaster of Paris.
      
      1. The plaster of Paris artisans must be skilled and quite experienced, if not, the desired design will not be achieved and the entire place would be super messy even without achieving the desired goal.
      
      2. The plaster of Paris installation is time-consuming, as it must be carefully installed and skillfully formed. And a simple mistake can lead to the scrapping off and wastage of the Plaster of Paris, leading to the team starting all over again.
      
      3. Then there is the tendency of risk features falling off if not properly installed.
      Designs of the plaster of Paris.
      
      Several designs of the plaster of Paris exist and we will be sharing quite a few.
      
      1. Embedded squares: this is formed when you have a very large square and then other squares are found within it, reducing in size as the number of squares reduces. In the end, it looks like " rings of squares within squares"
      
      2. Circular designs: these are best for living rooms giving them that lively and luxurious look.
      
      3. Rectangular: This is best for dining rooms. Giving cosy yet luxurious vibes.
      Locations for the installation of Plaster Of Paris.
      
      1. The living room: The plaster of Paris designs in the living room can be extravagant giving it the luxurious look and in itself, be the attraction. Feeding the eyes of whoever visits and telling its tale by just sitting up there.
      
      2. The dining room: This kind of design should strike a balance between being minimalistic and also being classy.
      
      3. Kitchen: The plaster of Paris for the kitchen should be simple and quite functional, serving its aesthetical look with functional lighting embedded in the POP to serve the user. The Plaster of Paris can withstand the heat and smoke of the kitchen, it is also fire-resistant. So with POP, your kitchen is good to go.
      
      How much does it cost to fix the Plaster of Paris?
      
      Plaster of Paris ceilings is not quite as expensive as their counterparts. The price varies, per square foot. In Nigeria, the installation costs NGN4,500 per square meter.
      
      So the area of the ceiling to be installed will be calculated to know the actual cost. However, this price is not constant due to the fluctuating economy and the exchange rate.

      Depending on the colours of the wall, the colour of your ceiling should either complement or augment the entire space.
      
      In conclusion, the plaster of Paris is one of the most used materials for false ceilings.

      1. What are roof water collectors?
      2. Advantage of roof water collectors.
      3. Disadvantages of roof water collectors.
      4. Who does it best?
      
      What is a roof water collector?
      
      A roof water collector is a channel or a pathway (usually a trough) forming the components of a roof system which collects and diverts water away from the edges of the roof. Roof water collectors can be known as rain gutters or rain catchers.
      
      Canadians often refer to it as an eaves trough or a dumpster.
      
      Advantages of installing roof water collectors. (Rain gutters)
      
      1. Roof water collectors help the soil around the building remain stable and prevent Foundation issues.
      
      2. Roof water collectors greatly reduce the need for repainting.
      
      3. Roof water collectors help protect the exterior walls of the building from water damage.
      
      4. Roof water collectors help keep the entrances dry when it's raining.
      
      5. Roof water collectors help prevent driveways, walkways and concrete slabs from cracking.
      
      6. Roof water collectors help increase the value of the property relatively.
      
      7. Roof water collectors help prevent soil erosion.
      
      8. Roof water collectors give fascia protection.
      
      9. Roof water collectors help in the protection of the landscape.
      
      10. Roof water collection help in the collection of water, for water usage.
      
      Roof water collectors serve a lot of purposes. Say, for example, a building's foundation, roof water collectors help protect a building's foundation by channelling or changing the direction of the original base. Roof water collectors also help to reduce erosion and help prevent leakage in basements.
      
      Roof water collectors help prevent rain splashbacks on the walls. Thereby protecting the painted walls from dirty splashbacks. This in turn increases the value of the property in the real estate market.
      
      Roof water collectors can also be very effective in keeping building egress areas clear of falling water (Rain) When it's raining heavily, you don't want to be that person who counts one... two... three! And then runs into the house but still gets wet due to the falling water. It feels like you are walking through a water fountain with no control.
      
      This great reduction in moisture also helps you to keep the entrance surfaces moisture free and free of microorganisms like algae, spirogyra, moss, and slime that could grow and cause the surfaces to be slippery.
      
      Roof water collectors help boost the value of your property. Having a properly installed roof water collector in place helps add value to your property in the long run. Exterior add-on (aesthetics) increases the value of buildings. Studies have shown that exterior add-on has a high percentage return on investment. In the real estate industry, a book is judged by its cover many a time. The buildings stand out in a beautiful way which adds to their aesthetic.
      
      Roof water collector provides a means for rainwater use. This is called rainwater harvesting. Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater using various methods which include our main topic of discussion.
      
      Water harvesting is a "do it yourself" project that can help you achieve a lot. This is a way of being environmentally responsible as well and it could help reduce your water bill.
      It is an environmentally friendly technology. Collecting this water, can help recharge the groundwater beneath you and protect your local water supply from pollution and erosion.
      It reduces the noise usually generated by hitting the floor directly.
      
      Disadvantages of roof water collection.
      
      1. Excessive cost.
      2. Difficulty in water movement.
      3. Uncertain water quality.
      4. Poor installation.
      5. Poor maintenance
      6. Poor longevity.
      7. Ugliness.
      
      Excessive cost: The cost of the roof water collector could be a bit on the high side. But knowing this is an investment and that you get value for your money in the long run. (The general value of the property)
      
      Difficulty in water movement: In roof water collectors, difficulty in the movement of water may occur. Stuff could get stuck in the trough thereby obstructing the free flow of water.
      
      Uncertain water quality: In a case where the collected water will be reused, the quality of the collected water is uncertain so it may not be useful for certain activities It could be useful in probably wetting gardens and the like around the house.
      
      Poor installation: This could be a great source of concern in this case. This is because, if the water collector is poorly installed, issues may arise making it as good as useless. Hence, proper installation is a top priority and professionals only, should be entrusted with this installation so you don't end up wasting your money or installing twice.
      
      Poor maintenance: this could also be a disadvantage because if it is not properly taken care of (clearing the pathway to incase anything gets stuck) it could render the entire system useless.
      
      Ugliness: this occurs when the installers do not perform a neat job. May in a particular pattern or style. It could make the building itself look ugly instead of beautifying it in its little way.
      
      Types of Roof water Collectors (Rain gutters)
      
      Roof water collectors are in several sizes and shapes.
      
      One of the most common types of gutter used in the present day is the open gutter which comes in standard lengths.
      
      Several residential roof water collectors come 5 inches and are made of either aluminium, steel, zinc, vinyl (PVC) or copper in a standard 'k' form.
      
      The typical 5 inches k-style rainwater gutter holds more water than the half-rounds type of the same capacity.
      
      For commercial applications, box gutters can be made in 3 or 8 inches or even more water.
      Shapes of rain gutters.
      
      There are two basic types and they are often referred to by the shape of their cross-section.
      
      1. K-style gutters: These types have flat bottoms and backs and the front side of the gutters usually has a decorative shape. The 'k' in the 'k-style' refers to the vague curve of the outer shape when viewed from the side. These types of ornate gutters are popular with modern homes because of the moulding-like silhouette. Coming in all manner of colours and finishes including, aluminium, galvanized steel, PVC, and copper.
      
      These stylish systems easily blend into the architectural details of a home.
      
      2. Half-round gutters: These types are often found in older, historic homes. The name for this gutter type is not hard to figure out, given the half-rounded shape of the material itself. Half-round gutters today gained clarity in Europe as modern homes chose to adopt a period that looked similar to these used centuries ago. The utmost advantage of the half-round style over the k style is the ability to manoeuvre debris within the gutter itself, the symmetrically smooth interior of half-round gutters is ideal for transporting runoffs with ease.
      
      They are easier to clean and are less likely to corrode since water does not have anywhere to accumulate.
      
      Round-off gutter systems hold less water than similarly sized k style gutter systems making them unappealing for homes in places with very high annual rainfall.
      But generally, k style gutters are twice the capacity of their half-round gutter counterpart of the same width and costs up to 50% more per linear foot. K-style gutter systems remain the industry's standard because of the elegant shape resembling interior crown moulding.
      Professionally installed gutters are the best. These gutters are out and fashioned on-site.
      Metal like Aluminium copper and stainless steel are generally chosen for high-end installations.
      The most cost-effective is the aluminium gutters. A high percentage of professional installations are done with aluminium gutters. And it's amazing because they do not rust. 
      
      They also have light weight and are very efficient at channelling water out.
      
      If they are properly installed, aluminium gutters will last well over 60 years.
      And that's exactly where we come in.
